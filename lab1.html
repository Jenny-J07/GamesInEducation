		<summary>Task 1</summary>
		<br>
		Potential Topics:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Machine ethics</li>
			<li>Ethics in information storage/collection</li>
			<li>Information security</li>
			<li>AI in the workplace</li>
			<li>Games in education</li>
			<li>Digital media in cultural heritage</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>

		<h4>Refined Topic List</h4>		
		<ul>
			<li>Ai in the workplace</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Both students and people potentially affected by AI in the workplace would be benefit from engaging with this topic.
				<br>Some people will already have some knowledge about it â€“ this could be people who are already experiencing AI being
				<br>implemented in their workplace. I may need to persuade some students it is worth learning as it could affect them in
				<br>the near future. This topic could be beneficial as it would give an overview of how AI is being implemented in the
				<br>real world and how this could have an impact in different fields of work. </li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>Games in Education</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Students, game developers and teaching staff could benefit from this topic. Students might have experience if they
				<br>have used educational games before. Teachers might also have some knowledge of this topic if they have ever used
				<br>educational games in their teaching. This could help to persuade teachers that games used for education could have a
				<br>positive impact when teaching. </li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>Digital Media in Cultural Heritage</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Museum staff/goers might benefit from this topic. This would also be interesting for anyone who is interested in using
				<br>technology to preserve cultural heritage. People who have seen or interacted with any forms of digital media in a museum
				<br>might have some experience with this. I might have to use examples of digital media in cultural heritage sights to show
				<br>that they can be interesting and useful in the preservation of cultural heritage. </li>
			</ul>
			
			
		</ul>
			
		<br><br>
		I have chosen the topic - Games in Education.<br>
		This is because I feel most passionate about this topic. There are several directions I can go in with this topic. I think it could have a positive impact 
		for students as well. <br>
		<br>
		If designing for students it could be used as a website to give them different options of educational games.<br>
		For teachers, it could be used to give them advice on how to implement educational games in their lessons. <br>
		For game developers, it could be used as a resource for helping them develop educational games.<br>
		<br>
		I think AI in the workplace could be a good topic, but I don't know a lot about AI used in workplaces. So this topic would require a lot of researching 
		time to make sure that I make the site informative. <br>
		<br>
		I am interested in Digital Media in Cultural Heritage, but I have selected Games in Education over this simply because I feel more passionate about 
		discussing the benefits of educational games. I think it is better to select the topic I am more passionate about as this will encourage me 
		to further research and work on my project. <br>
