				<p class="info-text">When selecting games, it is best to take both age and difficulty level into account.
					Make sure to check the age to make sure it is appropriate for your class. You should also consider 
					the difficulty level to make sure it won't be too easy or difficult for the children. This could 
					lead to them being disinterested.

				<h2 class="info-heading">Considering Accessibility Needs</h2>
				<p class="info-text">
					Accessibility needs must be taken into account when selecting games. 
					For information on audio and blind-accessible games look at AudioGames.net. 
					For auditory needs, find out whether the game has closed captions or not. 
					If considering for a physical disability, one-switch games can be good as they only 
					require one or two buttons. Slow motion gameplay can also be more accessible if available. Although some games may require a dedicated controller. 
					For disabilities such as dyslexia or dyscalculia, you are better to assess whether the game is appropriate through testing.

			<div class="info-box info-card-front" onclick="cardFlip(this)">
				<h2 class="info-heading">Analysing and Testing Games</h2>
				<p class="info-text">
					When selecting a game, it is important to test it to check its suitability. 
					Is the game suitable for the age group you are teaching? Think about the language used, and cultural considerations, are these appropriate. 
					When it comes to gameplay, does it have an easy learning curve with helpful feedback. Does it contain good educational content, and does it contain a help section? 
					Think about the time the children may need to complete it and if it would be suited to team work. 
					Take a look at our ‘Considering Accessibility Needs’ section for more information on accessibility.

			<div class="info-box info-card-front" onclick="cardFlip(this)">
				<h2 class="info-heading">Online Safety</h2>
				<p class="info-text">
					It is always important to keep children’s safety in mind. 
					Things to consider are whether the game needs an internet connection to be played. Does the selected game gave any form of online communication. 
					If so, will this game be safe for children to play? Is there a way to make turn any online chat feature’s off? 
					If you would like to use a game with online communication, does it monitor for bullying? Check to see if there is a feature to report unacceptable behaviour? 
					Considering all of these things will help to make the children’s experience while playing safer. 
					It is a good idea to teach your class about internet safety as there are also games that can help with this.

				<h2 class="info-heading">Create Your Own Games</h2>
				<p class="info-text">
					You may want to also consider creating your own games. This could be extremely beneficial to focus on content that suits your class plan. 
					If you find yourself with limited coding knowledge, platforms like GameMaker or Scratch can be a good starting point for building your own games.
